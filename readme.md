### Number2Words

Tech: JS, HTML, CSS.

Will convert any number from 0 to 999,999 into it's English word equivalent:
![76455288.png](:storage/509be453-3336-4342-9355-de2f5b7c800e/76455288.png)

*(**Disclaimer**: no monkey pictures in this one whatsoever).*

Started as a way to introduce a young chap to the world of numbers and programming, yet it grew to its funky current state (along with the creator himself).

Since it's a simple HTML app, just download in any folder and open `index.html`!

Any corrections/comments/suggestions are welcome.
